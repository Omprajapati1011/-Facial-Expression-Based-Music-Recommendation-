# -Facial-Expression-Based-Music-Recommendation-
Developed an AI-driven music recommendation system that detects facial expressions in real-time and plays music based on the detected emotions. Utilized OpenCV for face detection, FER (Facial Expression Recognition) for emotion classification, and TensorFlow for model training using the FER2013 dataset. 
## Dataset (FERâ€‘2013)

This project uses the FERâ€‘2013 dataset (facial expression recognition).

- Download it from: **https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013**  
- Place the `fer2013.csv` (or extracted folder) into the `dataset/` directory  
- (Ensure `dataset/` is listed in `.gitignore`)

Once placed, run:

## ðŸŽµ Music Dataset (Local)

This project uses a **local music dataset** for song recommendation based on detected facial expressions.
